    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.25 lbs chicken thighs (4 to 5 thighs)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <er>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp salted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 lb potato gnocchi (dry)</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Dice the chicken thighs into 2-inch pieces. Add the chicken to a bowl and top it with Italian seasoning,
            smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix until combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat and add the cooking oil. Once it's shimmering, add the chicken
            and cook undisturbed until well browned, about 3 minutes. Stir and brown on the other side, about 3 more
            minutes.Remove the chicken from the pan when it's cooked through and leave the fat in the pan.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the onion and garlic to the skillet. Saute until the onions have softened and the garlic is fragrant,
            about 2 minutes</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the gnocchi and 1 tablespoon salted butter to the skillet and brown for 2 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the spinach and the broth to the skillet. Cover the pan. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes until the spinach has
            wilted and the gnocchi has hydrated.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the heavy cream and the remaining 1 tablespoon of salted butter to the skillet. Stir until the butter
            has melted and the cream is steaming hot but not boiling.</p></li>
        <li><p>Take the skillet off the heat. Add the parmesan to the pan and stir until it melts, creating a velvety
            sauce.</p></li>
        <li><p>Finally, return the cooked diced chicken to the skillet. Mix gently into the gnocchi and cream sauce. If
            desired, garnish with parsley.</p></li>
        </li>
    </ol>
